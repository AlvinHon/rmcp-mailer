# MCP Server for Personal Mailer

An example project for a rust-based MCP ([Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction)) server for personal mailer. It enables the users to send emails simply making prompts to the LLM chat interfaces such as Cursor and Copilot.

This is implemented by using the official [rust sdk](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/rust-sdk) for MCP (in active development).
It mainly uses the crate [lettre](https://crates.io/crates/lettre) as the SMTP client under the hood.

TODOs:
- [ ] add smtp administration
- [ ] support more request types, e.g. schedule meetings.
- [ ] add recipient management

## Usage

This section describes some use cases to show that the MCP server is more interesting than the traditional email programs.


Traditional email programs require the user know how to input the data to the program in order to work (e.g. sending an email). Here, we can just use simple words and the LLM will help us to create the input data so that it can be fitted into the "program".

**Example 1:**

```text
send an formal email to Bob (bob@domain.com). invite him to my friend Chris's wedding. closing with my name "Alvin"
```

<details>
<summary>Sample Output</summary>

LLM:
```text
Email sent successfully!
```

SMTP:
```text
From: test@test.com
Subject: Invitation to Chris's Wedding
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
To: bob@domain.com
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

    ```sh
    python -m aiosmtpd -n -l 127.0.0.1:2525
    ```
1. Follow this [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/customizing-copilot/extending-copilot-chat-with-mcp) to set up the MCP agent in your VSCode.
1. Start the MCP agent by clicking the "start" button in the file `mcp.json` in VSCode.
1. Run the MCP server:
